            <h1>
                <day>Day 2:</day> Common Cyber Threats</h1>

            <h2>1. Malware</h2>
            <p>Malware is malicious software designed to infiltrate or damage a computer system without the owner's consent. It includes viruses, worms, trojans, spyware, adware, and more.</p>

            <h2>2. Phishing</h2>
            <p>Phishing is a type of social engineering attack where attackers masquerade as a trustworthy entity to deceive individuals into providing sensitive information, such as passwords, credit card numbers, or other personal data.</p>

            <h2>3. Ransomware</h2>
            <p>Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts files on a victim's computer, rendering them inaccessible, and demands payment (usually in cryptocurrency) for the decryption key. It often targets individuals, businesses, or organizations.</p>

            <h2>4. Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks</h2>
            <p>DoS attacks aim to disrupt a network or service, making it unavailable to its intended users. DDoS attacks involve multiple compromised systems flooding the target with traffic, amplifying the impact.</p>

            <h2>5. Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks</h2>
            <p>In this attack, an attacker intercepts communication between two parties, such as between a user and a website, to eavesdrop on or manipulate the communication.</p>

            <h2>6. SQL Injection</h2>
            <p>SQL Injection is an attack targeting SQL databases by injecting malicious SQL code into input fields, exploiting vulnerabilities in an application's software to access or manipulate the database.</p>

            <h2>7. Zero-Day Exploits</h2>
            <p>Zero-Day Exploits are attacks that target vulnerabilities in software or hardware that are unknown to the vendor or developer, hence "zero-day." Attackers exploit these vulnerabilities before a patch or fix is available, making them particularly
                dangerous.
            </p>

            <h2>8. Insider Threats</h2>
            <p>Insider Threats are posed by individuals within an organization who have access to sensitive information and may misuse it intentionally or unintentionally.</p>

            <h2>9. Password Attacks</h2>
            <p>Password Attacks involve various techniques, such as brute force attacks, dictionary attacks, and phishing, used to gain unauthorized access to user passwords.</p>

            <h2>10. Cryptojacking</h2>
            <p>Cryptojacking is the illegitimate use of a victim's computing resources to mine cryptocurrency without their consent or knowledge. It often involves infecting a victim's computer with malware.</p>

            <p>These are just a few examples of common cyber threats. As technology evolves, so do the tactics and methods used by cybercriminals, making it essential for individuals and organizations to stay vigilant and adopt robust cybersecurity measures.</p>

        <div class="python-card">
            <h1>
                <day>Day 4:</day> Fundamentals of Cryptography</h1>
            <p>Cryptography is the practice and study of secure communication techniques that allow for the transformation of data into a format that is unintelligible to anyone except those possessing a specific key or keys to decrypt the data. Here are
                the fundamentals of three important cryptographic techniques: encryption, hashing, and digital signatures:</p>

            <h2>Encryption:</h2>
            <p>Encryption is the process of converting plaintext (ordinary, readable text) into ciphertext (unreadable text) to secure it from unauthorized access. Encryption relies on algorithms and keys. There are two main types of encryption:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Symmetric Encryption:</strong> In symmetric encryption, the same key is used for both encryption and decryption. Both the sender and receiver must know the key. Popular symmetric encryption algorithms include AES (Advanced Encryption
                    Standard), DES (Data Encryption Standard), and 3DES (Triple DES).</li>
                <li><strong>Asymmetric Encryption (Public-Key Encryption):</strong> Asymmetric encryption uses two different keys - a public key and a private key. The public key is used for encryption, while the private key is used for decryption. This allows
                    anyone to encrypt messages using the recipient's public key, but only the recipient possessing the corresponding private key can decrypt them. Common asymmetric encryption algorithms include RSA, ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography),
                    and ElGamal.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Hashing:</h2>
            <p>Hashing is a one-way process that converts input data (plaintext) into a fixed-size string of characters, which is usually a hexadecimal representation. The output is called a hash value or digest. The key characteristics of hash functions
                are:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Deterministic:</strong> The same input will always produce the same hash value.</li>
                <li><strong>Quick Computation:</strong> The hash function should compute the hash value quickly.</li>
                <li><strong>Preimage Resistance:</strong> It should be computationally infeasible to reverse the hash function to find the original input data.</li>
                <li><strong>Collision Resistance:</strong> It should be difficult to find two different inputs that produce the same hash value.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Hash functions are widely used for password hashing, data integrity verification, digital signatures, and various other cryptographic applications. Common hashing algorithms include SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-3, and MD5 (though MD5 is considered
                weak for cryptographic purposes due to its vulnerability to collision attacks).</p>

            <h2>Digital Signatures:</h2>
            <p>Digital signatures provide a way to verify the authenticity and integrity of digital messages or documents. They are created using asymmetric encryption techniques and provide non-repudiation, meaning the signer cannot later deny their signature.</p>
            <p>To create a digital signature:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The sender hashes the message using a cryptographic hash function.</li>
                <li>The sender encrypts the hash value with their private key, creating the digital signature.</li>
                <li>The signature is sent along with the message.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>To verify a digital signature:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The recipient hashes the received message using the same hash function.</li>
                <li>The recipient decrypts the signature using the sender's public key to obtain the hash value.</li>
                <li>The recipient compares the computed hash with the decrypted hash. If they match, the signature is valid.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Common digital signature algorithms include RSA, DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm), and ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm).</p>

            <h1>
                <day>Day 5:</day> Introduction to Network Security</h1>
            <p>Network security is essential for protecting computer networks and their data from unauthorized access, misuse, or malicious attacks. Here's an introduction to some key components of network security:</p>

            <h2>Firewalls:</h2>
            <p>Firewalls are security devices or software applications that monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. They act as a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks
                (such as the internet). Firewalls can be implemented as hardware appliances, software programs, or a combination of both.</p>
            <p>Types of firewalls include:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Packet Filtering Firewalls: Examines each packet of data passing through the network and filters them based on predetermined criteria (such as source/destination IP address, port number, etc.).</li>
                <li>Stateful Inspection Firewalls: Keeps track of the state of active connections and makes decisions based on the context of the traffic.</li>
                <li>Proxy Firewalls: Act as intermediaries between internal and external networks, intercepting and inspecting all incoming and outgoing traffic.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Virtual Private Networks (VPNs):</h2>
            <p>VPNs provide a secure, encrypted connection between two or more endpoints over a public network (usually the internet). They allow users to access and transmit data securely over an untrusted network as if they were directly connected to a
                private network. VPNs are commonly used for remote access, site-to-site connectivity, and maintaining privacy and confidentiality.</p>
            <p>VPN technologies include:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Remote Access VPNs: Enable individual users to securely connect to a private network from a remote location.</li>
                <li>Site-to-Site VPNs: Establish secure connections between multiple remote sites or networks over the internet.</li>
                <li>SSL VPNs: Use SSL/TLS protocols to provide secure remote access to web-based applications and resources.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):</h2>
            <p>IDS monitor network traffic for suspicious activities or security policy violations. They analyze network packets or log files to identify potential security threats or attacks. IDS can be deployed as hardware appliances, software applications,
                or host-based systems.</p>
            <p>Types of IDS include:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Network-based IDS (NIDS): Monitor network traffic in real-time and detect suspicious patterns or signatures indicative of attacks.</li>
                <li>Host-based IDS (HIDS): Run on individual hosts or servers and analyze system logs and file integrity to detect unauthorized access or malicious activities.</li>
                <li>Hybrid IDS: Combine features of both NIDS and HIDS for comprehensive network security monitoring.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS):</h2>
            <p>IPS are advanced security appliances or software applications that not only detect but also actively prevent or block malicious activities or network attacks. They can automatically respond to detected threats by blocking malicious traffic,
                reconfiguring firewall rules, or alerting administrators.</p>
            <p>IPS functionalities may include:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Signature-based Detection: Recognize known attack patterns or signatures and block malicious traffic accordingly.</li>
                <li>Anomaly-based Detection: Identify abnormal behavior or deviations from expected network traffic patterns, which may indicate new or unknown threats.</li>
                <li>Protocol Analysis: Inspect network protocols and traffic to detect and prevent protocol-specific attacks.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Effective network security requires a combination of these technologies along with proper configuration, regular updates, and proactive monitoring to mitigate potential security risks and safeguard sensitive data and resources.</p>

            <h1>
                <day>Day 12:</day> Common Web Vulnerabilities</h1>

            <h2>1. SQL Injection (SQLi):</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Description:</strong> SQL injection is a type of attack where an attacker inserts malicious SQL statements into input fields or parameters of a web application, exploiting vulnerabilities in the application's database layer.</li>
                <li><strong>Impact:</strong> SQL injection attacks can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, data manipulation, data leakage, and in some cases, complete compromise of the database server.</li>
                <li><strong>Example:</strong> An attacker may craft a malicious SQL query to bypass authentication controls and retrieve user credentials from the database.</li>
                <li><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to sanitize user input, validate and restrict input data, and implement proper access controls to prevent SQL injection attacks.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Description:</strong> Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts (typically JavaScript) into web pages viewed by other users. XSS attacks can be stored (persistent), reflected,
                    or DOM-based, depending on where the injected script is executed.</li>
                <li><strong>Impact:</strong> XSS attacks can result in session hijacking, phishing, cookie theft, defacement of web pages, and the theft of sensitive information entered by users.</li>
                <li><strong>Example:</strong> An attacker may inject a malicious script into a comment field on a website, which is then executed by other users' browsers when viewing the page, allowing the attacker to steal session cookies.</li>
                <li><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Use input validation and output encoding to sanitize and escape user input, implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to restrict the execution of inline scripts, and sanitize user-generated content to
                    prevent XSS attacks.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>3. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Description:</strong> Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that tricks users into unintentionally executing malicious actions on a web application where they are authenticated. Attackers exploit the trust between a user's
                    browser and a web application to perform unauthorized actions on behalf of the user.</li>
                <li><strong>Impact:</strong> CSRF attacks can lead to unauthorized transactions, data manipulation, account takeover, and other malicious activities.</li>
                <li><strong>Example:</strong> An attacker may craft a malicious HTML page or email containing a hidden form that submits a request to a vulnerable web application on behalf of an authenticated user, such as changing the user's email address
                    or transferring funds.</li>
                <li><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Implement anti-CSRF tokens (CSRF tokens) in web forms to validate the origin and integrity of requests, enforce the same-origin policy, and use additional security mechanisms such as SameSite cookies and double-submit
                    cookies to prevent CSRF attacks.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Mitigating these common web vulnerabilities requires a combination of secure coding practices, input validation, output encoding, access controls, and security testing. Regular security assessments, vulnerability scanning, and penetration
                testing are essential for identifying and remediating vulnerabilities in web applications. Additionally, staying informed about emerging threats and best practices in web application security is crucial for maintaining a robust security
                posture.
