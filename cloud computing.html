                <day>Day 1:</day> Introduction to Cloud Computing</h1>

            <h2>Definition and Evolution of Cloud Computing</h2>
            <p>Cloud computing refers to the delivery of computing services over the internet ('the cloud') to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. It has evolved from traditional on-premises IT infrastructure and virtualization
                to abstracting infrastructure entirely, allowing users to access computing resources on-demand.</p>

            <h2>Characteristics of Cloud Computing</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>On-demand self-service:</strong> Users can provision computing resources automatically without human interaction.</li>
                <li><strong>Broad network access:</strong> Services are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms.</li>
                <li><strong>Resource pooling:</strong> Computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model.</li>
                <li><strong>Rapid elasticity:</strong> Computing capabilities can be rapidly and elastically provisioned to scale out and in with demand.</li>
                <li><strong>Measured service:</strong> Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use, providing transparency for both provider and consumer.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Benefits and Challenges</h2>
            <h3>Benefits:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Cost Efficiency</li>
                <li>Scalability</li>
                <li>Flexibility and Accessibility</li>
                <li>Reliability</li>
                <li>Innovation</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Challenges:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Security and Privacy Concerns</li>
                <li>Dependency on Internet Connectivity</li>
                <li>Compliance and Legal Issues</li>

                <day>Day 2:</day> Cloud Service Models</h1>

            <h2>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</h2>
            <p>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is a cloud computing model that provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. In IaaS, users can rent virtual machines, storage, and networking components on a pay-as-you-go basis. This model
                offers flexibility and scalability, allowing users to manage and control their infrastructure without the need for physical hardware.</p>

            <h2>Platform as a Service (PaaS)</h2>
            <p>Platform as a Service (PaaS) is a cloud computing model that offers a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without dealing with the complexity of building and maintaining the underlying infrastructure. PaaS
                provides a ready-to-use environment with tools and services, enabling developers to focus on application development and deployment rather than infrastructure management.</p>

            <h2>Software as a Service (SaaS)</h2>
            <p>Software as a Service (SaaS) is a cloud computing model that delivers software applications over the internet. Users can access these applications through a web browser without the need for installation or maintenance. SaaS eliminates the
                burden of software updates and hardware management, providing a cost-effective and accessible solution for end-users.</p>

            <h2>Examples</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Amazon Web Services (AWS):</strong> Offers a range of IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS services, including EC2 (IaaS), Elastic Beanstalk (PaaS), and Amazon S3 (SaaS).</li>
                <li><strong>Microsoft Azure:</strong> Provides IaaS services like Azure Virtual Machines, PaaS services like Azure App Service, and SaaS solutions like Microsoft 365.</li>
                <li><strong>Google Cloud Platform (GCP):</strong> Offers IaaS with Compute Engine, PaaS with App Engine, and SaaS with G Suite.</li>
                <li><strong>Heroku:</strong> A PaaS platform that simplifies application deployment and management for developers.</li>
                <li><strong>Salesforce:</strong> A SaaS provider offering CRM services over the cloud.</li>

                <day>Day 3:</day> Cloud Deployment Models</h1>

            <h2>Public Cloud</h2>
            <p>A public cloud deployment model involves hosting cloud resources and services on infrastructure provided by a third-party cloud service provider. These resources are made available to the general public, and users can access and utilize them
                on a pay-as-you-go basis.</p>

            <h2>Private Cloud</h2>
            <p>In a private cloud deployment model, computing resources are exclusively used by a single organization. This model offers enhanced control, security, and customization, making it suitable for businesses with specific regulatory or compliance
                requirements.
            </p>

            <h2>Hybrid Cloud</h2>
            <p>Hybrid cloud deployment combines elements of both public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them. This model provides greater flexibility, enabling organizations to leverage the benefits of both public
                and private clouds based on their specific needs and workload characteristics.</p>

            <h2>Community Cloud</h2>
            <p>A community cloud is shared by multiple organizations with common concerns, such as industry-specific regulatory requirements or security standards. This model allows organizations within the community to collaborate and share resources while
                maintaining a level of isolation from other cloud users.</p>

            <h2>Examples</h2>
