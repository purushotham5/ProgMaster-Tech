            <h1>
                <day>Day 2:</day> Version Control with Git
            </h1>

            <h2>Introduction to Git</h2>
            <p>Git is a distributed version control system used to track changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple developers to collaborate on projects and maintain a complete history of changes.</p>

            <h2>Setting up Git and Basic Commands</h2>
            <p>To set up Git, you need to install it on your local machine and configure it with your name and email address. Some basic Git commands include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>git init</code>: Initialize a new Git repository</li>
                <li><code>git clone</code>: Clone a repository from a remote server</li>
                <li><code>git add</code>: Add files to the staging area</li>
                <li><code>git commit</code>: Commit changes to the repository</li>
                <li><code>git push</code>: Push changes to a remote repository</li>
                <li><code>git pull</code>: Pull changes from a remote repository</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Working with Branches and Pull Requests</h2>
            <p>Branches in Git allow you to work on different versions of your code simultaneously. You can create a new branch, make changes, and merge it back into the main branch using pull requests.</p>

            <h2>Git Workflows</h2>
            <p>Gitflow is a popular branching model that defines a strict branching model designed around the project release. It provides a robust framework for managing larger projects.</p>

            <h2>Git Best Practices</h2>
            <p>Some best practices for using Git include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Committing frequently and keeping commits small and focused</li>
                <li>Writing clear and descriptive commit messages</li>
                <li>Using branches for new features or bug fixes</li>
                <li>Regularly pulling changes from remote repositories to stay up to date</li>
                <li>Resolving merge conflicts promptly</li>
            </ul>
