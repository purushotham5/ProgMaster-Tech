                <day>Day 1:</day> Introduction to Embedded Systems</h1>

            <h2>Definition and Evolution of Embedded Systems</h2>
            <p>An embedded system is a specialized computing system that is part of a larger system or machine, designed to perform specific functions. It is embedded into a larger device for a dedicated purpose.</p>
            <p>Example: A washing machine controller is an embedded system that controls various functions such as water intake, temperature regulation, and spin cycle timing.</p>

            <h2>Characteristics of Embedded Systems</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Real-time Operation:</strong> Embedded systems often operate in real-time, meaning they must respond to external events within a specified time frame.</li>
                <li><strong>Low Power Consumption:</strong> Many embedded systems are battery-powered or have strict power constraints, requiring efficient use of energy.</li>
                <li><strong>Limited Resources:</strong> Embedded systems typically have limited processing power, memory, and storage compared to general-purpose computers.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Example: Wearable fitness trackers use low-power embedded systems to monitor activity and heart rate while maximizing battery life.</p>

            <h2>Benefits and Challenges</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Benefits:</strong> Embedded systems offer tailored solutions for specific tasks, high reliability, and cost-effectiveness.</li>
                <li><strong>Challenges:</strong> Designing embedded systems involves addressing challenges such as hardware-software co-design, real-time constraints, and system integration.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Example: Industrial automation systems use embedded systems for precise control of machinery, improving efficiency and reducing human error.</p>

                <day>Day 2:</day> Embedded System Components</h1>

            <h2>Microcontrollers vs. Microprocessors</h2>
            <p>Embedded systems utilize either microcontrollers or microprocessors, each serving distinct purposes.</p>
            <p><strong>Microcontrollers:</strong> Integrated circuits containing a processor core, memory, and peripherals on a single chip. They are designed for specific tasks and are commonly used in embedded applications.</p>
            <p>Example: The Arduino Uno board employs a microcontroller to execute programmed tasks, making it suitable for various projects such as robotics and home automation.</p>

            <p><strong>Microprocessors:</strong> Central processing units (CPUs) that require external components like memory and peripherals. They are more powerful and versatile, often used in general-purpose computing devices.</p>
            <p>Example: A desktop computer uses a microprocessor (e.g., Intel Core i7) for running diverse applications and tasks.</p>

            <h2>Sensors and Actuators</h2>
            <p>Embedded systems interact with the physical world through sensors and actuators.</p>
            <p><strong>Sensors:</strong> Devices that detect and measure physical properties like temperature, light, or motion.</p>
            <p>Example: In an automotive airbag system, accelerometers serve as sensors, triggering airbag deployment in the event of a collision.</p>

            <p><strong>Actuators:</strong> Components responsible for carrying out actions based on sensor inputs, such as motors or servos.</p>
            <p>Example: In a robotic arm, actuators control the movement of joints, allowing precise positioning and manipulation.</p>

            <h2>Memory Units</h2>
            <p>Memory is crucial in embedded systems for storing program instructions and data.</p>
            <p><strong>Types of Memory:</strong> Embedded systems use different types, including ROM (Read-Only Memory) for storing permanent data and RAM (Random Access Memory) for temporary data storage during operation.</p>
            <p>Example: In a digital camera, ROM stores firmware, while RAM temporarily holds image data during processing.</p>

                <day>Day 5:</day> Embedded System Design Patterns</h1>

            <h2>State Machine Design</h2>
            <p>State machine design is a pattern used in embedded systems to model the behavior of a system by defining its states, transitions, and actions. It is particularly useful for systems with distinct operational modes.</p>
            <p>Example: In a traffic light control system, the state machine design pattern can be applied to model the states (red, yellow, green) and transitions between them based on predefined conditions like time intervals and sensor inputs.</p>

            <h2>Observer Pattern</h2>
            <p>The observer pattern is employed in embedded systems to establish a one-to-many dependency between objects. When one object (the subject) changes its state, all its dependents (observers) are notified and updated automatically.</p>
            <p>Example: In a weather monitoring system, multiple display modules can act as observers. When the sensor detects a change in temperature, humidity, or pressure, the observer pattern ensures that all display modules are updated with the latest
                data.
            </p>

            <h2>Producer-Consumer Pattern</h2>
            <p>The producer-consumer pattern facilitates communication and coordination between different parts of an embedded system. It involves a producer that generates data and a consumer that processes or uses that data.</p>
            <p>Example: In an automated manufacturing system, a sensor acting as a producer detects the completion of a product on the assembly line. The consumer, such as a robotic arm, then processes this information to pick up and transfer the finished
                product to the next stage.</p>
